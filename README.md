# Cataclysm Protocol
**Turn-Based Tactical Survival Game | Unity 2D**

A survival RPG where you choose your apocalypse. Combine different disaster types to create unique survival scenarios, then navigate the aftermath as a scientist seeking long-term human survival.

## 🎮 Project Overview
* **Genre:** Turn-Based Tactical RPG / Survival
* **Engine:** Unity 2022.3 LTS
* **Status:** In Development

## 🌍 Core Concept: Choose Your Apocalypse

The game features a modular disaster system — players select which catastrophes shape their world before each playthrough:

| Category | Disaster Types |
|----------|----------------|
| Climate | Extreme Cold, Extreme Heat, Rising Seas, Acid Rain, Thunderstorms |
| Ecology | Biological Mutation, Weaponized Evolution, Mass Proliferation |
| Technology | AI Uprising, Self-replicating Nanobots, Global EMP Events |
| War | Nuclear Wasteland, Alien Invasion |
| Cosmic | Solar Anomalies, Asteroid Impact, Supervolcano |
| Supernatural | (Easter egg category) |

Disasters can be combined — face mutated creatures AND periodic electromagnetic storms, or survive extreme cold in a nuclear wasteland. Each combination creates different resource challenges, enemy types, and survival strategies.

### Demo Scenario
**Weaponized biological mutations + Periodic solar EMP storms**

Engineered predators hunt with terrifying efficiency, exploiting human weaknesses by design. Meanwhile, electromagnetic pulses periodically disable technology, making recovery nearly impossible. As a scientist, you see what others don't: every threat is also a potential resource.

## ⚔️ Core Systems

### Combat System
* **Initiative-based turns:** Dynamic turn order based on stats
* **Grid-based tactics:** Positioning and terrain matter
* **D&D-inspired mechanics:** Attack rolls, armor class, dice-based damage
* **Action Point management:** Strategic resource allocation

### Creature AI
Enemies feature behavior tree-driven AI with unique abilities:

*Example - Mantis Grapple State Machine:*
```
NORMAL → [Grapple Success] → GRAPPLING → [Release Check] → NORMAL
                                  ↓
                            Bite Attack
                            (turn counter tracked)
```

### Survival Layer
* **Needs system:** Water (clean/dirty), Food (nutrients, contamination), Temperature
* **Environmental hazards:** Vary based on selected disasters
* **Resource scarcity:** Every threat is a potential resource

## 🔧 Technical Highlights
* Interface-driven design (`ICombatTarget`, `IMobAction`)
* Behavior tree architecture for diverse enemy AI
* Modular disaster system affecting gameplay variables
* Event-based UI updates
* Grid-based pathfinding

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

> *"Every threat is a resource. Every weakness can be exploited — including your own."*

* **Player agency:** Choose your challenges before the game begins
* **Replayability:** Different disaster combinations = different experiences
* **Tactical depth:** Enemies are puzzles, not just obstacles
* **Scientist fantasy:** Knowledge and adaptation over brute force
